            My main interests are in scripting with Python and Bash. I also enjoy
            programming in Java, as well as things relating to memory management
            through utilizing C/C++. I love being creative and crafting engaging
            websites using ReactJS. Outside of technology, I love playing music on
            my piano and guitar.

            during the Spring 2024 semester. During my time as a URA, I was able
            to develop important technical skillsets related to research. In the course,
            my research group was able to develop a novel algorithm which would surpass
            the industry standard, the DEFLATE algorithm, in compressing large data sets
            of varying characteristics. My time in research has led to an interest in
            pursuing a MS in Computer Science starting in Fall 2026.

            In addition, I'm passionate about teaching, especially in being able to explain
            difficult concepts as simply as possible in layman's terms. I would
            love to be able to apply my teaching and communication skills to
            help my team tackle challenging problems with a clear direction in
            mind.
